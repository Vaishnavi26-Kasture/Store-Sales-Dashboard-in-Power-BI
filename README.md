## Sales Forecasting in the Dashboard
### Description
The Sales Forecasting feature in the Power BI dashboard provides predictive insights into future sales performance. By leveraging historical sales data, the dashboard projects sales trends for upcoming periods, helping stakeholders make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.

### Objective:
Predict future sales trends based on past performance.
Enable proactive planning and decision-making.
### Methodology:

#### Forecasting Algorithm: Power BI uses built-in statistical models (such as exponential smoothing or ARIMA) to calculate future sales values.
- Input Data: Historical sales data (e.g., daily, monthly, or yearly).
- Output: Predicted sales values for future periods along with confidence intervals.
Visual Representation:

#### A Line Chart displays:
- Actual sales trends for historical data.
- Forecasted sales represented as an extended line with shaded confidence intervals.
- Forecasted Period: Define the time horizon for the forecast (e.g., next 6 months or 1 year).
#### Filters and Drill-Downs:
- Forecasting can be segmented by product category, store, or region to provide more granular predictions.
### Purpose and Benefits
- Inventory Management: Ensure adequate stock levels for anticipated demand.
- Budgeting and Planning: Set realistic sales targets and allocate resources effectively.
- Risk Mitigation: Identify potential sales declines early and adjust strategies accordingly.
- Marketing Insights: Plan campaigns around projected high-demand periods.
### How to Use Forecasting in the Dashboard
- Select the forecasted time range using slicers or date filters.
- Use confidence intervals to understand the range of potential outcomes.
- Drill down into specific categories or regions to see targeted forecasts.
